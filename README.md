Unity3D-Reward-System
=====================

Just a simple reward system.

Reward system with 3 types of chests, each generating different reward at a given time interval that can then be collected
chests have generated reward for each interval and maximum amount of coins that they can hold, reaching the maximum
amount stops the timer, collection the reward restarts the timer. There are two toggle buttons that can add handicap or 
bonus to the collected values of each chest. 
The code is not very meaningful, as it was just a test task and was not intended as part of any project. The timer and
rewards are active only in the running instance and nothing is remembered but it may save someone some time as the chest
classes are implemented.
The UI is with relative positions to the size of the screen, although in not very readable way, but again i was experimenting
with styling and placing of the elements and it is only my second try with unity 3D and was done in a day - day and a half.

Again I'm uploading only the scripts and the executable file with the required directory, the project should run on all 
resolutions.
